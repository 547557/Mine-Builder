# Hunyuan3D-2GP: 3D Generation for the GPU Poor
*GPU Poor version by **DeepBeepMeep**. This great video generator can now run smoothly with less than 6 GB of VRAM.*
<BR>

This is another integration of the *mmgp 3.1* module that allows easy to setup advanced and fast offloading.\

## üî• News
- Jan 22, 2025: üí¨ Hunyuan3D-2.0GP by Deepbeepmeep: low VRAM support and unlocked text to 3D generator
- Jan 21, 2025: üí¨ Release [Hunyuan3D 2.0](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tencent/Hunyuan3D-2). Please give it a try!


## **Abstract**

We present Hunyuan3D 2.0, an advanced large-scale 3D synthesis system for generating high-resolution textured 3D assets.
This system includes two foundation components: a large-scale shape generation model - Hunyuan3D-DiT, and a large-scale
texture synthesis model - Hunyuan3D-Paint.
The shape generative model, built on a scalable flow-based diffusion transformer, aims to create geometry that properly
aligns with a given condition image, laying a solid foundation for downstream applications.
The texture synthesis model, benefiting from strong geometric and diffusion priors, produces high-resolution and vibrant
texture maps for either generated or hand-crafted meshes.
Furthermore, we build Hunyuan3D-Studio - a versatile, user-friendly production platform that simplifies the re-creation
process of 3D assets. It allows both professional and amateur users to manipulate or even animate their meshes
efficiently.
We systematically evaluate our models, showing that Hunyuan3D 2.0 outperforms previous state-of-the-art models,
including the open-source models and closed-source models in geometry details, condition alignment, texture quality, and
e.t.c.

## How to run the Gradio app
1) Follow the installation instructions below

2) Enter either one of the commande lines in bash session

To run the image to 3E generator:
```bash
python gradio_app.py
```

To run the text to 3D generator:
```bash
python gradio_app.py --enable_t23d

```

By default the memory profile assumes 9 GB of VRAM *(profile 2)*. If you have less but at least 6 GB of VRAM add *--profile 5*

To run the image to 3D generator with optimized memory management:
```bash
python gradio_app.py --profile 5

```
To run the text to 3D generator with optimized memory management:
```bash
python gradio_app.py --enable_t23d --profile 5

```

You can choose between 5 profiles depending on your hardware:
- HighRAM_HighVRAM  (1): at least 48 GB of RAM and 12 GB of VRAM 
- HighRAM_LowVRAM  (2): at least 48 GB of RAM and 6 GB of VRAM
- LowRAM_HighVRAM  (3): at least 32 GB of RAM and 12 GB of VRAM
- LowRAM_LowVRAM  (4): at least 32 GB of RAM and 6 GB of VRAM
- VerylowRAM_LowVRAM  (5): at least 24 GB of RAM and 6 GB of VRAM 

Usualy the lower the profile the faster the generation.

## Other GPU Poor Applications
- HuanyuanVideoGP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/HunyuanVideoGP\
One of the best open source Text to Video generator

- FluxFillGP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/FluxFillGP\
One of the best inpainting / outpainting tools based on Flux that can run with less than 12 GB of VRAM.

- Cosmos1GP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Cosmos1GP\
This application include two models: a text to world generator and a image / video to world (probably the best open source image to video generator).





### Architecture

Hunyuan3D 2.0 features a two-stage generation pipeline, starting with the creation of a bare mesh, followed by the
synthesis of a texture map for that mesh. This strategy is effective for decoupling the difficulties of shape and
texture generation and also provides flexibility for texturing either generated or handcrafted meshes.

### Performance

We have evaluated Hunyuan3D 2.0 with other open-source as well as close-source 3d-generation methods.
The numerical results indicate that Hunyuan3D 2.0 surpasses all baselines in the quality of generated textured 3D assets
and the condition following ability.

| Model                   | CMMD(‚¨á)   | FID_CLIP(‚¨á) | FID(‚¨á)      | CLIP-score(‚¨Ü) |

## ü§ó Get Started with Hunyuan3D 2.0

You may follow the next steps to use Hunyuan3D 2.0 via code or the Gradio App.

### Install Requirements

Please install Pytorch via the [official](https://pytorch.org/) site. Then install the other requirements via

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# for texture
cd hy3dgen/texgen/custom_rasterizer
python3 setup.py install
cd hy3dgen/texgen/differentiable_renderer
bash compile_mesh_painter.sh
```

### API Usage

We designed a diffusers-like API to use our shape generation model - Hunyuan3D-DiT and texture synthesis model -
Hunyuan3D-Paint.

You could assess **Hunyuan3D-DiT** via:

```python
from hy3dgen.shapegen import Hunyuan3DDiTFlowMatchingPipeline

pipeline = Hunyuan3DDiTFlowMatchingPipeline.from_pretrained('tencent/Hunyuan3D-2')
mesh = pipeline(image='assets/demo.png')[0]
```

The output mesh is a [trimesh object](https://trimesh.org/trimesh.html), which you could save to glb/obj (or other
format) file.

For **Hunyuan3D-Paint**, do the following:

```python
from hy3dgen.texgen import Hunyuan3DPaintPipeline
from hy3dgen.shapegen import Hunyuan3DDiTFlowMatchingPipeline

# let's generate a mesh first
pipeline = Hunyuan3DDiTFlowMatchingPipeline.from_pretrained('tencent/Hunyuan3D-2')
mesh = pipeline(image='assets/demo.png')[0]

pipeline = Hunyuan3DPaintPipeline.from_pretrained('tencent/Hunyuan3D-2')
mesh = pipeline(mesh, image='assets/demo.png')
```

Please visit [minimal_demo.py](minimal_demo.py) for more advanced usage, such as **text to 3D** and **texture generation
for handcrafted mesh**.

### Gradio App

You could also host a [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) App in your own computer via:

```bash
pip3 install gradio==3.39.0
python3 gradio_app.py
```

Don't forget to visit [Hunyuan3D](https://3d.hunyuan.tencent.com) for quick use, if you don't want to host yourself.
